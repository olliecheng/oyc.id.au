**Originally written for the r/UCAT Discord server in response to a question.**

Hi, these are all the thoughts of `@denosawr#8290` (light mode, the mod) so if you have opinions/think I'm not being fully accurate, please flick me a DM and I'll correct it!

A common question I see is 'how should I balance UCAT and study?' or 'how do I balance my school subjects?' Oftentimes, in part because of productivity culture YouTube, the answer that lots of students want to hear is: "take this magical potion and your day will last 30 hours, so you can finish all the study you think you need to get done." Alas, if such a potion exists - I sure wish I had one during high school!

In my opinion, the sad answer is that if you're struggling to balance your subjects - maybe overwhelmed by schoolwork, and finding yourself unable to focus on UCAT - it will be very difficult to make more time magically. In this kind of situation, I have a few points of advice, but notice that all my suggestions will **not** enable you to finish everything you want to, because we're all human after all.

1. Identify your priorities and execute them. Task management can be a fantastic way to accomplish this. It's easy to say, "I should finish these Spec questions because I think Spec is really important", but equally easy to say that about any other school subject. Instead, you might find it helpful if you break down your school obligations into conceptual learning - a priority, always - practice, and revision. In doing so, you can find it easier to identify work which isn't essential, and which can be deferred until later.

2. Are UCAT/ATAR/A-levels really that important? For the uni you're interested in, understand their admissions requirements and process so you can understand which metrics are the most important for your chances of admission. In WA, for instance, I spent less time grinding UCAT because the score requirements weren't that high over there (in 2021, a ~3000 UCAT was a relatively safe score). Alternatively, if your current ATAR is on track to be a 99.9, do you really need to put in double the work to get a perfect score? Yes, pride might tell you so... but if you end up bombing your UCAT, then pride won't get you a medical spot. A final example is for students who might choose to spend less time on UCAT in favour of ATAR, which I would recommend you consider if you're within reach of a Chancellor's Scholarship or Griffith medicine.

3. Plan ahead. You know when your exams are, and when your UCAT is. You know when school terms are. You know when you'll be busy. Plan accordingly. For instance, I did the vast majority of my UCAT revision over the holidays, as I knew in advance that when the grind of school starts, I just wouldn't have time to practice. Similarly, I booked my UCAT to be at the end of the holidays, so that I could use the term break studying. It's only your own fault if all your responsibilities come rushing towards you at once and you haven't planned sufficiently.

4. Study is great, study is life, med or dead and all... but don't neglect the benefits of taking care of yourself. One reason why I personally despise productivity culture is that it insinuates that life is only about the grind and the constant attainment of a perfect study session. Productivity culture also suggests that you should aim to do _everything_ you possibly can. This isn't always true. I'm the first advocate for working super hard to achieve your dreams, but please don't sacrifice your mental or physical health for that. Not only is a stupid number on a sheet of paper not worth _you_, being in a worse mental/physical situation **will** have a toll on your abilities to study, concentrate, and perform in exams. It's a self-perpetuating cycle. One of the easiest things to try to avoid mentally is to blame yourself for having a bad day and promise yourself that you'll 'catch up' tomorrow - you probably won't, and the workload will build up. If you miss a study session, then see if you can fit it in on a day where you're not too busy, and if you can't - so be it. You're human, everybody makes mistakes, not everybody studies all the time.

I got a fantastic ATAR and UCAT by following these tips. While I studied a lot, I didn't study every day all day - I had cocurriculars after school usually for about 2 hours per day, and I loved them. Finding opportunities to look out for yourself, as well as knowing your limits and planning the next year, will go very far and is a skill beneficial in both study and life.

Cheers and best wishes! \\
