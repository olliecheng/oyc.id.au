My name is Ollie and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. I'm interested in applying my studies in mathematics, computing, and biology to better interpret and model biological systems.

At the moment I work casually as a research assistant at the [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute](https://wehi.edu.au) in the Davidson Lab, with a primary focus on developing methodology for the demultiplexing of barcoded long-read sequencing data. I'm open and interested in learning more about bioinformatics and mathematical biology.

I'm currently taking [Statistics](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/mast20005), [Stochastic Modelling](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/mast30001), [Principles of Human Structure](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/anat20006), and [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/comp20003/) as a second year student. Previously, I took the graduate-level [Computational Genomics](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/comp90016/) subject through the Community Access Program.

I also tutor the Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE). If you're here for that, please see my dedicated [Tutoring](/tutor/) page. You should have a read through some of the [articles](/tutor/#my_articles) I've written!

If you would like to get in touch, my contact details can be found [here](/contact/).
