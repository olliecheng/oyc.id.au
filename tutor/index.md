# Tutoring
Hi! I'm a former student who now works with high school students to help them improve. I'm passionate about sharing what I learnt in high school to help students perform at their best.

I studied the WACE curriculum and scored a perfect ATAR of 99.95. My TEA was 420/430. I also received a scaled score of 100% in Specialist Mathematics and was ranked 2~~~<sup>nd</sup>~~~ in the state in Literature.

At the moment, I'm a Chancellor's Scholar (and Honours List recipient) at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), majoring in Statistics. I plan to pursue a Doctor of Medicine after my undergraduate degree through the guaranteed entry program. [(Some other offers I received)](why/#my_medical_school_offers)

I also do some research work (bioinformatics) at the [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute](https://wehi.edu.au) in Melbourne. I plan to write more about my journey into academic research, and the transition from high school into university. If you're an ambitious student and are interested in research, I'd love to chat.

I offer tuition for both individuals and [small group classes](https://checkpointeducation.com.au). My current rate for 1-1 classes is \$70/h.

* I run small group classes with two other 99.9+ ATAR friends, at [Checkpoint Education](https://checkpointeducation.com.au). Our rates are very competitive. If you want an effective, affordable class with personalised support, check it out.

This page is a small collection of the resources, write-ups, and guides which I've made over the years. If you have any suggestions for new articles, please do [get in touch](/contact)!

## My articles
* My [WACE Resources Guide](/posts/wace-resources-guide) has been quite popular; it's a list of which exams and textbooks I found useful during my own studies.
* [A few UCAT tips](/posts/ucat-tips) contains some advice from when I took the UCAT. At the time I scored a 3200 (after technical difficulties).
* I hold a free annual [Interview tips](/posts/interview-tips) seminar where I give prospective applicants some simple, practical advice on how to succeed during the face-to-face medical interview process. It'll be back this year - watch out!
* I was asked to prepare a slide on my [current university study plan](/posts/uni-study-plan) for a talk. I've linked it here in case there's anybody interested in studying Maths & Stats and where that can take you.
* I used to run the [WACE papers archive](https://olliecheng.me/papers) ([GitHub](https://github.com/olliecheng/wace-paper-archive)) which was also quite popular, but unfortunately have had to take it down due to concerns about copyright. I am no longer responding to requests for resources. However, a little birdie tells me that the files live on...
